# React CLI tool

`npm i -g @fabiendeborde/re4ct-cli`\
`yarn add global @fabiendeborde/re4ct-cli`

A simple CLI tool I made to help cope with all the boilerplate code needed to create components.\
It is based on the architecture I use in my projects:
  - pages & components directories
  - a component is a folder, containing the jsx code, js style file, test file & package.json for easy import

## Usage
Run help command to see available commands.
> re4ct --help
